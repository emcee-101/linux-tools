# LinuxPerfTools

small bash scripts for setting specific thingw on (my) linux devices including: 
- to max out gaming performance on my (amd graphic card) linux pc [deprecated in the sense of that it is not up to my standards regarding cod equality anymore]
- to set a limit to the percentage my notebook is getting charged to increase battery health (similar to official battery health tools on windows)
