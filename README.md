# LinuxPerfTools

small bash scripts for setting specific things on (my) linux devices including: 
- PerformanceScript.sh is tweaking kernel and CPU governor settings to increse gaming performance [deprecated in the sense of that it is not up to my standards regarding code quality anymore]
- powerlimit.sh to set a limit to the percentage my notebook is getting charged to increase battery health (similar to official battery health tools on windows)
